###Pico Core###
PicoCore - the core framework that handles broadcasting of a pico enabled web application, and lookup of other pico web applications on the network.

###Pico Root###

PicoRoot - A simple Servlet 3 application, compiling as a WAR to be deployed to a servlet container.
PicoRootSpringBoot - the same application packaged as a Spring Boot stand alone jar.


### Example Hello World##'
